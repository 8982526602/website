Website generator for phpMyAdmin
================================

This is currently in alpha state, but later it will hopefully replace
phpMyAdmin homepage.


Requirements
------------

Python - http://www.python.org/

python-feedparser - http://www.feedparser.org

Security announcements
----------------------

To create new security announcement, copy templates/security/_PMASA_ to
templates/security/PMASA-YYYY-N and edit it's content.


Page generating
---------------

All page has it's own template. For most things it mean inclusion of
other templates to generate full page. These partial includes should be
named with underscore as first character (eg. _page.tpl).

To add new page, simply drop file to templates directory named
something.tpl and it will be automatically used as a template on next
run.

All pages should at the end include _page.tpl to get layout and other
common things. You can see example page at templates/_sample_.tpl


Menu
----

Menu is configured in render.py, first element always means page name
(extension is added automatically) second menu item title.


Themes
------

Themes require additional metadata, which is stored in themes.py.


Awards
------

All awards are listed in awards.py.


Markup rules
------------

(See genshi docs for more details).

- $ is special char to indicate template variable, to escape it, use $$
- comments which first char is ! (eg. <!--! comment -->) will not be in output
