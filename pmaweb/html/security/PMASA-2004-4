<py:def function="announcement_summary">
Two vulnerabilities were found in phpMyAdmin, that may allow
command execution and file disclosure.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_description_fmt">
<p>
We received a security advisory from Nicolas Gregoire (exaprobe.com) 
about those vulnerabilities and we wish to thank him for his work.
Both vulnerabilites can be exploited only on a web server where PHP 
safe mode is off.
The vulnerabilities apply to those points:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Command execution: since phpMyAdmin 2.6.0-pl2, on a system where
external MIME-based transformations are activated, an attacker can put
into MySQL data an offensive value that starts a shell command when browsed.
 </li>
 <li>File disclosure: on systems where the UploadDir mecanism is active, read_dump.php can be called with a crafted form; using the fact that
the sql_localfile variable is not sanitized can lead to a file disclosure.
 </li>
</ol>
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_severity">
As any of those vulnerabilites can be used for command execution or file
disclosure, we consider them to be serious (on servers where PHP safe mode is off).
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_affected">
Command execution problem: since phpMyAdmin 2.6.0-pl2. File disclosure problem: 
vulnerable since at least version 2.4.0.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_unaffected">
CVS HEAD has been fixed.
The 2.6.1-rc1 release.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_solution">
We strongly advise everyone to upgrade to version 2.6.1 when released. Meanwhile, setting PHP safe mode to on avoids those problems. If not feasible, you should deactivate MIME-based external transformations and the UploadDir mecanism.
