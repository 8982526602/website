<py:def function="announcement_summary">
Multiple XSS vulnerability were found in phpMyAdmin, that may allow an
attacker to conduct Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_description_fmt">
<p>
We received a security advisory from Cedric Cochin (netvigilance.com)
about those vulnerabilities and we wish to thank him for his work.
The vulnerabilities apply to those points:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>The logic used to auto-detect the PmaAbsoluteUri parameter can be fooled
by adding an extra &quot;/&quot; and a crafted URL.
 </li>
 <li>read_dump.php can be called with a crafted url; using the fact that
the zero_rows variable is not sanitized can lead to an attack.
 </li>
 <li>The confirm form (for example after a DROP DATABASE statement) can 
be used for a XSS attack.
 </li>
 <li>The internal phpMyAdmin parser does not sanitize the error message sent
after an error like a punctuation problem.
 </li>
</ol>
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_severity">
As any of those vulnerabilites can be used for a XSS attack, we consider them 
to be serious.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_affected">
Not all previous versions are affected by all vulnerabilities, but it's safe
to say that releases up to and including 2.6.0-pl2 are at risk.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_unaffected">
CVS HEAD has been fixed.
The upcoming 2.6.0-pl3 release.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_solution">
We strongly advise everyone to upgrade to the next version of phpMyAdmin, which is to be released soon.
