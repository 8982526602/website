<h2>Team meetings</h2>

<p>
We would like to meet other members of the team more often; so far only two
team meetings in real life have happened. The first one was at a big party 
in Karlsruhe, Germany for the 10th anniversary of PHP and MySQL at the 
<a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2005">LinuxTag</a> 2005
<a href="http://www.lamparea.org/">LAMP Area</a>, with some special
guests.
</p>
<p>The second meeting took place in Brussels, Belgium during 
<a href="http://fosdem.org/2010">FOSDEM 2010</a>. Marc Delisle talked
about &quot;State of phpMyAdmin&quot; in the MySQL developer room.
</p>
<p>The third meeting took place in Brussels, Belgium during 
<a href="http://fosdem.org/2012">FOSDEM 2012</a>. The team talked about
future directions for the project.
