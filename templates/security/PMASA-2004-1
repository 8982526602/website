<py:def function="announcement_summary">
When faking table with specific name, an attacker can make phpMyAdmin
to execute arbitrary php code and add custom server configuration.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_description">
phpMyAdmin used eval function to fill some values and one parameter
used there was table name. When specifying specially formatted table
name, this could lead to eval attacker code. However this requires also
a modified MySQL server, that will return these table names, as normally
MySQL doesn't allow it. With conjunction to not checking input variables,
attacker can make phpMyAdmin use patched MySQL server he wants.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_severity">
Default configuration is not affected by this issue, it can happen only
when $$cfg['LeftFrameLight'] is FALSE. When this condition is met,
attacker can execute arbitrary php code which is shipped by his patched
MySQL version. If php is running in safe mode or there is firewall not
allowing outgoing connections to outside machines, this issue can not
cause any harm. As this can cause serious problems, we consider this
issue as critical.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_affected">
All releases starting with 2.5.1 up to and including 2.5.7.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_unaffected">
All releases older than 2.5.1.
CVS HEAD has been fixed.
The upcoming 2.5.7-pl1 release.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_solution">
If you are vulnerable to this issue, we recommend to enable light left
frame mode, which disables eval code. We strongly advise everyone to
upgrade to CVS HEAD or to the next version of phpMyAdmin, which is to be
released soon.
