<py:def function="announcement_summary">
(1) Local file inclusion vulnerability and (2) Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_description_fmt">
<p>
We received a security advisory from Stefan Esser (sesser@hardened-php.net) about (1). We received a security advisory from Tobias Klein (tk@trapkit.de) about (2). We wish to thank both of them for their work.
</p>
<p>
(1) : Due to the sequence of execution in the code that gets form parameters in some scripts, it was possible to craft a special attack form that overwrites configuration parameters.
</p>
<p>
(2) : Some scripts were vulnerable to XSS attacks: left.php, queryframe.php and server_databases.php.
</p>
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_severity">
We consider these vulnerabilities to be serious. However, (1) can be exploited only on systems not running in PHP safe mode (unless a deliberate hole was opened by including in open_basedir some paths containing sensitive data).
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_affected">
We did not make an extensive verification on this. Probably all previous versions.
</py:def>


<py:def function="announcement_solution">
Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 2.6.4-pl3 or newer.
</py:def>
